  <ul id="tribute-info">
    <li> Morning of Sept. 26, 1983, Stanislav Petrov helped prevent the outbreak of nuclear war</li>
     <li>Colonel Petrov was at a pivotal point in the decision-making chain. His superiors at the warning-system headquarters reported to the general staff of the Soviet military, which would consult with Mr. Andropov on launching a retaliatory attack.</li> 
      <li>After five nerve-racking minutes - electronic maps and screens were flashing as he held a phone in one hand and an intercom in the other, trying to absorb streams of incoming information â€” Colonel Petrov decided that the launch reports were probably a false alarm.</li>
