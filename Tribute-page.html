      <h2 class="headlines">Life between 1939-1983</h2>
        <ul id="tribute-info"> 
          <li>Petrov was born to His father, Yevgraf (flew fighter aircraft during World War II), and his mother on 7 September 1939 near Vladivostok.</li>
          <li>Petrov enrolled at the Kyiv Military Aviation Engineering Academy of the Soviet Air Forces. In 1972 he graduated and joined the Soviet Air Defence Forces.</li>
          <li>In the early 1970s, he was assigned to the organization that oversaw the new early warning system intended to detect ballistic missile attacks from NATO countries</li>
          <li>During this time, He got married Raisa. They went on to have 2 children,a son Dmitri, and a daughter, Yelena.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2 class="headlines">The Day Petrov Saved the World</h2>
        <ul id="tribute-info">
          <li> Morning of Sept. 26, 1983, Stanislav Petrov helped prevent the outbreak of nuclear war</li>
          <li>Colonel Petrov was at a pivotal point in the decision-making chain. His superiors at the warning-system headquarters reported to the general staff of the Soviet military, which would consult with Mr. Andropov on launching a retaliatory attack.</li> 
          <li>After five nerve-racking minutes - electronic maps and screens were flashing as he held a phone in one hand and an intercom in the other, trying to absorb streams of incoming information — Colonel Petrov decided that the launch reports were probably a false alarm.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2 class="headlines">Life After That Day</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In 1984, Petrov left the military due to wife's illness and being reprimated for not pushing the button. At that point he got a job at the research institute that had developed the Soviet Union's early warning system. <br>-A BBC report in 1998 stated Petrov had suffered a mental breakdown and quoted Petrov as saying, "I was made a scapegoat."-</li>
          <li>After a 10 year battle with cancer his wife passed in 1997.</li>
          <li>He also went on to win many awards over the years and even had a movie mad about this experence. <br> Petrov said he did not know whether he should have regarded himself as a hero for what he did that day. In an interview for the film The Man Who Saved the World, Petrov says, "All that happened didn't matter to me—it was my job. I was simply doing my job, and I was the right person at the right time, that's all. My late wife for 10 years knew nothing about it. 'So what did you do?' she asked me. 'Nothing. I did nothing.'"</li>
          <li>During a visit to the United States for the filming of the documentary The Man Who Saved the World, Petrov toured in May 2007 the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site and, having retired from USSR military, commented, “[he] would never have imagined being able to visit one of the enemy’s securest sites.</li>
          <li>Petrov died on May 19, 2017 from hypostatic pneumonia, though it was not widely reported until September. He was 77 years old</li>
